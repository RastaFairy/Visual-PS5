/* The GPU's fixed-function blocks are GC 10.1.3's, the chip of the AMD BC-250

 * programs it as GC 10.1.3 with the GB_ADDR_CONFIG above), while register
 * programming and the shader core behave as GFX10.3's, the identity RADV gets.
 * So these traits come from Mesa's GFX1013 model, derived from the same inputs.
 * Each was first found on the console as a symptom (PS5_Vulkan RADV_PHASE.md,
 * 2026-09-27, has the audit), and the model gives every one of them; the
 * assertion keeps the model and the measurements in step across Mesa updates.
 *
 * - No accelerated dot products: v_dot4_u32_u8 does not compute here. NGG's
 *   workgroup repack sums its counts with it, and a geometry shader whose
 *   vertex count is not constant, or a tessellated patch NGG culling repacked,
 *   drew nothing; with the v_msad_u8 fallback both draw every texel (the RADV
 *   smoke title's geometry and tessellation checks).
 * - No GFX10.3 wave ID in TG_SIZE: a 128-invocation workgroup of wave64
 *   reported one subgroup where two ran
 *   (dEQP-VK.subgroups.multiple_dispatches.uniform_subgroup_size); bits 20-24
 *   read 0, and the ordered wave ID serves instead.
 * - No per-primitive NGG parameters: a fragment shader reading gl_PrimitiveID
 *   that no earlier stage writes read 0 behind an NGG vertex shader
 *   (dEQP-VK.pipeline.*.misc.implicit_primitive_id; the smoke title's
 *   primitive ID check).
 * - No strict vertex order: the second of two triangles read its per-vertex
 *   inputs rotated with or without ROTATE_PC_PTR, so
 *   VK_KHR_fragment_shader_barycentric is not reported (the smoke title's
 *   barycentric pair; dEQP-VK.fragment_shading_barycentric.data).
 * - No variable-rate shading: a 2x2 pipeline rate ran the fragment shader once
 *   a texel and read gl_ShadingRateEXT as 1x1 (the smoke title's shading-rate
 *   check; dEQP-VK.fragment_shading_rate), so VK_KHR_fragment_shading_rate is
 *   not reported. No RB+ either.
 * - No E5B9G9R9 colour target: every blit into it with a non-zero colour read
 *   back wrong (dEQP-VK.api.copy_and_blit.*.blit_image.all_formats.color.*.
 *   e5b9g9r9_ufloat_pack32, 500 cases).
 * - The TC-compatible HTILE clear bug: a depth-only image cleared to 0 read back
 *   1 after a draw whose fragments were all discarded
 *   (dEQP-VK.dynamic_state.*.discard.depth); its workaround sets
 *   ZRANGE_PRECISION 0 after a clear to 0.
 * - GFX1013's AddrLib revision: non-RB+ GFX10 swizzles with the depth/stencil
 *   mipmap fix Navi10 lacks. With a Navi10 revision a 256x256 D16 image with
 *   mips was laid out in three 64 KiB blocks, its 128x128 level in the mip tail,
 *   while the depth block wrote level 0 into a fourth
 *   (dEQP-VK.glsl.texture_functions.texture.sampler2dshadow_*).
 *
 * GFX1013's model differs from GFX10.3 in more than these; the rest is not
 * taken until measured here (the audit lists them). */
